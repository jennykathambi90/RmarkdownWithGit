How to use R markdown Documents with Git:

We will author an R Markdown document and render it to HTML. We discuss how to keep the intermediate Markdown file, the figures, and what to commit to Git and push to GitHub. If GitHub is the primary venue, we render directly to GitHub-flavored markdown and never create HTML.

We’ll practice with RStudio’s boilerplate R Markdown document.

We are modelling “walk before you run” here. It is best to increase complexity in small increments. We test our system’s ability to render the “hello world” of R Markdown documents before we muddy the waters with our own, probably buggy, documents.
